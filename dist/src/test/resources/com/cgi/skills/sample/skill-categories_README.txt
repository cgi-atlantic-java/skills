I came up with the primary and secondary categories listed below, each with some sample items.

Your feedback is highly appreciated. Please comment on this blog post.

    Java features and APIs:
        Configurable JVM feature (Garbage collection, Remote debugging, JMX, etc)
        Java language feature (Generics, Threads, Annotations, Enums, Lambdas, …)
        Java SE API (Collections, Date/Time, NIO, java.util.concurrent, …)
        Java EE API (EJB, JMS, JPA, JSF, JSP, …)
        Java SE UI (Swing, JavaFX, WebStart, Applets, …)
        3rd party Open Source web frameworks (Struts, Wicket, Spring MVC, …)
        Other 3rd party Open Source framework (Spring, Hibernate, …)
        Closed-source vendor technology (Java based but no JSR)
    Java Tools/Servers:
        Application Servers (Websphere, Weblogic, JBoss, Glassfish, Tomcat, Jetty, …),
        Developer Tools (IntelliJ, Eclipse, Netbeans, …)
        Build automation tools (Maven, Ant, Jenkins, Teamcity, Bamboo, …)
        Profiling and test tools (JVisualVM, SoapUI, JMeter, …)
    Methodologies (software engineering approaches and practices):
        Project level: Agile, Waterfall, RUP, …
        Engineering level: Dependency Injection (DI), Object-Oriented Development (OOP), Continuous Integration (CI), …
    Relevant non-Java technologies:
        Web technologies (HTML, CSS, JQuery, JavaScript, SVG, …)
        Scripting languages (bash, Perl, ksh, Groovy, ruby, etc)
        Operating systems (Linux, MacOS, Solaris, …)
        Database servers (Oracle, MS SQL server, Sybase, …)
        Team tools (Confluence, JIRA, Crucible, …)
        Other programming languages (C, C++, Cobol, Fortran, Scala, …)

I would include a “JVM Technologies” section, which for example could have a sub-section
for JVM languages (Scala, Clojure, JRuby, …)

The category hierarchy makes sense and is consistent. I would perhaps separate Java Tools
and Java Servers to main level subcategories of their own. What also would be useful is
some sort of self-assessment of skill level on each item (e.g. scale 1-5) and/or number
of years used professionally.
I wonder if the level of detail is a bit too high for an average hiring manager though?
